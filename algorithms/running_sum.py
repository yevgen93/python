# Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).
# Return the running sum of nums.

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,3,6,10]
# Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        final = []
        summ = 0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            summ += nums[i]
            final.append(summ)
        return final
